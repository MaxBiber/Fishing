# Marine Fish Data Analysis Dashboard üêüüåä

## About the Project  
This project leverages a synthetic dataset focused on marine fish and their environmental interactions to explore critical issues such as overfishing risks, environmental impacts, and fish population sustainability. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and serves as a valuable resource for data analysis, visualization, and awareness efforts in oceanography.  

The goal of this dashboard is to provide insights into marine biodiversity and the human impact on marine ecosystems through an interactive, user-friendly interface created in Excel.
